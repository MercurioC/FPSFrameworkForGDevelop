**FPS Framework for GDevelop** is a free and open-source toolkit designed to help you create single-player first-person shooters in GDevelop, powered by the Jolt 3D physics engine. Inspired by classic titles like *GoldenEye*, *Half-Life*, and *Halo*, this framework provides everything you need to build a fully-featured retro-style FPS with the ease of use of GDevelop.

### **Core Features**

- **FPS movement system**: walk, jump, sprint, crouch and interact with full 3D collision support.
- **Weapon system with ADS**: equip and switch weapons, aim down sights, reload.
- **Environmental interaction**: open doors/windows, activate switches and triggers.
- **Physics-based object interaction**: push crates, roll barrels, apply impulses in 3D space.
- **Quest system**: create missions with objective tracking and progression.
- **NPCs and enemies**: examples of Enemy AI that reacts to physics and player actions.
- **UI system**: display health, ammo, and damage feedback in a clear and responsive HUD.
- **Modular and customizable**: use each system independently or as a full FPS base.
- **Built on Jolt Physics**: smooth and realistic 3D interactions and collisions, with great optimization.

### **Bonus: TrenchBroom Integration Tool**

Included is a script that converts `.OBJ` models into `.JSON` layouts compatible with GDevelopâ€™s external layout system. This enables seamless integration of levels created in **TrenchBroom**, a beloved editor from the Quake modding community, even while GDevelop lacks a native 3D level editor.

### **Free and Open for the Community**

This framework is released entirely for free to support the growth of this amazing engine and to help more developers explore 3D FPS development in GDevelop!
